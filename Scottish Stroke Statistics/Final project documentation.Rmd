# Background

Cerebrovascular disease develops as a result of problems with the blood vessels supplying oxygen rich blood
to the brain.
Scotland has a high prevalence of the risk factors associated with cerebrovascular disease such as smoking
and high blood pressure. Despite a substantial decrease in rates of death over the last decade, treating and
preventing stroke is a national clinical priority for Scotland as outlined in the Stroke Improvement Plan.
The Information Services Division (now PHS) provides an annual update on cerebrovascular disease in
Scotland, including stroke, brain haemorrhage and ‘mini-stroke’

## Business intelligence and data-driven decision making

Public Health Scotland (PHS) and NHS Scotland can gain insights in the demand in service across Scotland and the local health boards. Anomaly high/low spikes in diagnoses or mortality rates when compared to the average like crude rate can warn of local factors that need adressing/chances of false negative diagnoses.

## Domain knowledge and the business context

Public Health Scotland (PHS) "vision is for a Scotland where everybody thrives. Focusing on prevention and early intervention, we aim to increase healthy life expectancy and reduce premature mortality by responding to the wider determinants that impact on people’s health and wellbeing."

PHS provides an annual update on cerebrovascular disease in Scotland, including stroke, brain haemorrhage and ‘mini-stroke’. The data is compiled  from NHS Scotland from the local health boards and local authority.

# Data

## Internal and external data sources

All the data came from PHS, 3 that covered the diagnoses or mortality rates for the health boards and local authority where supplied from CodeClan as part of the project brief. I sourced  the codes and labels csv from the PHS website.

## Types of data

The data came in Character and Double class types. Change the Character to Factors for use in models and graph work.

"Chr" an object that holds character strings

“Fctr” Factors refers to categorical variables that have a fixed and known set of possible values.

“Dbl” refers to a data type defined to hold numeric values with decimal points unlike integers that are whole numbers.

## Data formats

All data was downloaded as .CSV files

## Data quality and bias

Believe that the data was good quality and wasn't biased. There is some out of date health boards identifier codes that have been replaced used in the diagnoses or mortality rates datasets that will be up-to date if re-pulled from the PHS website. The data has been aggragated to a high level so wasn't as useful as I'd hoped in making predictive models.

# Ethics

## Ethical issues in data sourcing and extraction

I did not have any ethical concerns regarding the sourcing and extraction of this data. The data followed the GDPR frame work, with identifiable and non-required information removed.

## Ethical implications of business requirements

I don't believe that there is any ethical implications from the porject requirements, as this data is being used to focusing on prevention and early intervention in people health.

<br>
There's a more obvious difference diagnosis rates when age is taken into account. With very few under 44 being diagnosed, an increased risk from 45-74 and a higher risk above 75 age.
